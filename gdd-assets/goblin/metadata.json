  "detailedPrompt": "\"A goblin character standing in T-pose, inspired by the low-polygon, simplistic art style of RuneScape 2007. The goblin should have a green, rough-textured skin with visible warts and blemishes, bearing a mischievous grin. It is dressed in rustic, tattered cloth rags with a predominance of earthy tones. The goblin's physique is small and hunched, with oversized hands and feet, yet no weaponry is included. The character's eyes should be yellow, glowing, and slightly bulbous, adding to its mischievous persona.\"",
