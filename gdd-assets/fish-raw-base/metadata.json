  "detailedPrompt": "Model Description:\n\nThe base model for the basic raw fish is a simple, elongated 3D shape formed from a low polygon count mesh. It has an overall length that is approximately four times its height, with a gradually tapering design from the head to the tail. The head is slightly larger in size, representing around one-fifth of the total length.\n\nThe fish body is a combination of ovoid and cylindrical shapes, smoothly transitioning from the head to the tail. The geometry emphasizes the vertical curvature of the body, giving the impression of a slight bending or arching typical of a fish's natural shape.\n\nThe head is circular in shape when viewed from the front and tapers towards the body from the side view. It includes low-poly, basic representations of eyes, which are round and slightly protruding. The mouth is a simple, small, semi-circular indentation.\n\nThe tail is represented by two low-poly triangular shapes, split approximately at a 45-degree angle from the rear end of the body, giving a 'fan-like' appearance. \n\nThe dorsal (top) and pelvic (bottom) fins are single, elongated triangles extending out from the body and tapering towards their ends. The pectoral fins on either side are smaller triangular shapes, positioned just behind the head area. \n\nThe model should be rendered in a neutral gray, avoiding any textures or shading that would suggest a specific material type. The silhouette of the fish is clear and recognisable, even with",
