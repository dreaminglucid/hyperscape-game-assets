  "detailedPrompt": "Model Description:\n\nThis model depicts a pair of basic metal leg armor, designed in the low-poly, old-school RuneScape 2007 style. \n\nStarting from the top, the thigh guards are cylindrical, wrapping around the legs. They're segmented into three parts, each overlapping the one below to allow for movement. The segments have a basic, clean, and smooth geometric shape, with slight curves to mimic the shape of a leg. \n\nMoving downwards, the knee guards are semi-spherical and slightly larger than the segments of the thigh guards. They are connected to both the thigh guards and shin guards by small, flat rectangular plates, allowing for hinge-like movement.\n\nThe shin guards, similar to the thigh guards, are also cylindrical and segmented into three parts for mobility. They taper slightly toward the ankles, reflecting the natural shape of a leg. \n\nThe foot guards are shaped like simplified, slightly elongated shoes, covering the top of the feet and terminating at a blunt point to allow room for the toes. They are connected to the shin guards by another set of small, flat rectangular plates.\n\nThe entire model is in neutral shades of gray, with no specific material textures applied, ready for retexturing. Its silhouette is simple, iconic, and easily recognizable as leg armor, with clean geometry and clear shapes. The model is also symmetrical, with both leg armors being identical.",
