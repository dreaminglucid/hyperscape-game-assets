  "detailedPrompt": "Base Model: Basic Leather Chest Armor\n\nShape and Form: The basic structure of the chest armor is a simple, form-fitting body panel that extends down to the waist. It has a slightly convex shape to accommodate the chest and abdomen of the wearer. The shoulders are covered with small, rounded caps that extend to the upper arm. The back mirrors the front in shape and structure.\n\nGeometry and Detail: The armor features clean, low-poly geometry. The chest and back panels are each made up of a grid of small, flat polygons. The shoulder caps are hemispherical, composed of a half-dome of polygons. Some minor detailing includes a low-poly belt at the waist, and vertical seam lines running down the middle of both the front and back panels for added visual interest.\n\nColor and Texture: The model is rendered in a neutral gray color, with a flat, matte surface texture. There are no material-specific textures, making it suitable for retexturing with different materials later.\n\nStyle: The model adheres to the Old School RuneScape 2007 style, with a low poly count, simple shapes, and iconic silhouette. It's reminiscent of the game's signature aesthetic, with its charmingly blocky and simplistic design.",
