  "description": "A RuneScape 2 inspired chisel",
  "detailedPrompt": "For 3D generation, design a chisel inspired by RuneScape 2007 graphics. The chisel should feature a short, cylindrical handle with a medium-grey wood texture, showing slight grain for a used look. The metal tip, forged from low-poly silver metal, should be slightly weathered, tapering to a sharp point for detailed work. The junction between the handle and the metal tip should be secured with a worn, bronze band that also exhibits signs of use. Maintain the pixelated and low-resolution style characteristic of RuneScape 2007 for authenticity.",
