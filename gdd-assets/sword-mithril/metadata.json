  "description": "Basic sword with clean geometry, neutral design, low-poly RuneScape 2007 style",
  "detailedPrompt": "The basic sword model is designed with a simplistic and modest look, adhering to the low-poly aesthetic of RuneScape 2007. The model is completely symmetrical and has a proportionate, balanced design. \n\nStarting from the top, the sword has a narrow, pointed tip that smoothly tapers down into a straight, double-edged blade. The blade has a length-to-width ratio of roughly 6:1 and slightly widens near the hilt. The blade is uniformly flat, with a thin, centered ridge running from the base to the tip, splitting the blade into two equal halves.\n\nThe crossguard is a simple, straight bar perpendicular to the blade. It extends equally on both sides of the blade, with the length being approximately one-third the width of the blade. It has a rounded rectangular shape, with its width slightly less than that of the blade.\n\nThe hilt, or handle, is a cylindrical shape with a slightly larger diameter at the base, giving it a gentle taper upwards towards the crossguard. It is about one-third the length of the blade, maintaining comfortable proportions. \n\nFinally, the pommel at the base of the hilt is a simple, slightly flattened sphere shape. It is sized to be slightly larger than the diameter of the hilt at its base, providing a balanced end to the sword design.\n\nThe model is rendered in neutral grays, making it suitable for any textures and colors to be applied later. The design is clean",
