  "description": "Crossbow",
  "detailedPrompt": "\"Medieval-styled crossbow, in the aesthetic of Runescape2007, with dimensions of 1.5x1.2x0.5 feet. The body of the crossbow is constructed of aged, grainy oak wood, characterized by a deep, chestnut brown hue and subtle weathering details. The bow itself is designed from a rough, blackened iron material, imbued with a semi-gloss texture for a realistic metallic finish. The bow string is made from tightly coiled, frayed hemp rope in a muted beige color. The trigger and bolt mechanisms should exhibit an antiquated, worn-out steel appearance. The design, while retaining its medieval authenticity, also adheres to low-poly style, akin to Runescape2007 graphics.\"",
