  "description": "Basic coin with clean geometry, neutral design, low-poly RuneScape 2007 style",
  "detailedPrompt": "Shape: The base model is a simple, flat disk shape with a slight bulge in the center, making it look more three-dimensional. The diameter is about twice the thickness, creating a chunky, robust appearance. The edges of the coin are slightly rounded to remove sharpness. \n\nDetails: A thin, slightly elevated circular band runs along the outer edge of the coin, providing a subtle frame. Inside this band, on both faces of the coin, there is a simple, low-polygon raised design â€“ an iconic, stylized RuneScape symbol (e.g., a dragon head, a cross, a simple star). The design is symmetrical and clear enough to be easily recognizable even at a small scale.\n\nColor: The entire model is a neutral, flat gray color, without any specific material textures or effects. No gradients or shading is used, keeping the look simple and plain for easy retexturing.\n\nSurface: The surface of the coin is smooth and flat, without any scratches, dents, or other signs of wear and tear. \n\nStyle: The model adheres to the iconic, low-poly style of 2007 Old School RuneScape. It's simple, uncluttered, and easily identifiable.",
