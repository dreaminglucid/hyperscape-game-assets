  "detailedPrompt": "Model: Basic Bow\n\n1. Shape and Dimensions: The base model of the bow has a classic, symmetrical, D-shaped design. It's about two to three times as tall as an average RuneScape character. The width is relatively thin, maintaining a consistent thickness throughout the body, tapering slightly towards the tips.\n\n2. Structure: The bow's body is made up of a single, solid, elongated piece curving into a semi-circle at the top and bottom, connecting at the center to form the grip. The bowstring runs from one tip of the bow to the other, forming a tight line that bisects the bow's curve. \n\n3. Details: The grip in the middle is slightly thicker with small horizontal grooves for hand placement, providing a hint of realism without specific textures. The ends of the bow, where the bowstring attaches, feature small, simple, cylindrical shapes for the notches. The bowstring is a thin, straight line with slight angular bends at the points where it attaches to the bow's tips.\n\n4. Colors: The bow, including the grip and notches, is rendered in a neutral gray, while the bowstring is white. No specific wood textures or colors are applied, making it suitable for retexturing.\n\n5. Style: The design maintains the simple, low-poly aesthetic of RuneScape 2007. It has a clean geometry and a clear, iconic silhouette that is easily identifiable as a bow.",
