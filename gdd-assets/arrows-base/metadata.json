  "description": "Basic arrow with clean geometry, neutral design, low-poly RuneScape 2007 style",
  "detailedPrompt": "MODEL: Basic Arrow\n\n1. SHAFT: The main body of the arrow is a long, straight cylindrical shape taking up about 80% of the total length. It is a neutral gray color, with no specific texture. The diameter is consistent along this length, and ends abruptly where the arrowhead begins.\n\n2. ARROWHEAD: The arrowhead is a simple, low-poly pyramid shape located at the top end of the shaft. It is slightly larger than the shaft diameter. It is a slightly darker gray than the shaft.\n\n3. FLETCHING: At the opposite end of the arrowhead, three equally spaced, low-poly triangular shapes represent the feathers or fletching. They are about one-fifth of the total arrow length and have a slightly lighter gray color than the shaft. \n\n4. NOCK: The very end of the shaft, behind the fletching, is a small cylindrical indent designed to accommodate the bowstring.\n\nOverall, the arrow maintains a clean and simple geometric design, with a clear silhouette that is instantly recognizable. The neutral color palette allows for easy retexturing later. The model reflects the iconic old-school RuneScape 2007 style, with its low-poly count and simple shapes.",
