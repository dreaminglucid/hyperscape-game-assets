  "detailedPrompt": "Model Description:\n\nThe model represents a basic cooked fish with clear geometry and simple shapes. It features a streamlined form to depict a fish, retaining the iconic silhouette. \n\nThe body of the fish is elongated and somewhat oval in shape with a slight bulge in the middle, representing the fish's body. The tail is a triangular shape, tapering towards the end and widening towards the body. The fish has a small triangular dorsal fin on the top and a similar, slightly smaller triangular ventral fin on the bottom, both midway along the body.\n\nThe fish's head is a rounded triangle with a flat base where it connects to the body. The mouth area is suggested with a simple indented line, and there are two small circles for eyes on the sides of the head.\n\nThe model is entirely in muted, neutral gray tones, without any specific material textures. The poly count is kept low to match the style of Old School RuneScape 2007. The model has a smooth surface, suitable for retexturing with different materials at a later stage. \n\nThe model does not include any specific details such as scales, as these will be added in the texturing phase. Instead, the model focuses on the overall shape and proportions of a basic cooked fish.",
