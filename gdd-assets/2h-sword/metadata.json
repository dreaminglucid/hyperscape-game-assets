  "detailedPrompt": "3D Asset Description: \n\nA two-handed medieval sword designed for combat, with a total length of 1.5 meters. The blade, 1.2 meters long and 10 cm wide, features a double-edged design, crafted from reflective steel with subtle wave patterns indicative of layered forging. The sword's crossguard is intricately designed, representing a runescape2007 style with its rustic bronze finish. The hilt, 30 cm long, is wrapped in worn dark-brown leather, providing a firm grip. The pommel is a spherical geometric shape, matching the bronze finish of the crossguard, which adds balance to the weapon and completes its formidable appearance.",
