  "detailedPrompt": "\"A small imp character inspired by the low-polygon aesthetics of RuneScape 2007, standing in a T-pose for rigging compatibility. This imp should have a mischievous expression and be adorned with pointy ears, tiny horns, and bat-like wings. Its body should display a reddish-brown texture, mimicking a rough, worn-out leather look. The imp's hands and feet should end in sharp, curved claws. The imp's body should be slim but muscular, with its wings folded back neatly against its body. The eyes should be oval, glowing bright yellow for a supernatural effect. No weapons are needed for this character model.\"",
