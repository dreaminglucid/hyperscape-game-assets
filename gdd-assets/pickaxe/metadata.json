  "description": "A RuneScape 2 inspired pickaxe",
  "detailedPrompt": "Generate a 3D asset of a pickaxe, heavily inspired by the RuneScape 2007 aesthetic. The pickaxe should bear a rugged, geometric design, featuring a long, straight wooden handle with a slightly weathered texture, showcasing its use. The pick's head, designed in a symmetrical, angular form, should be made of a rich, dark metal, indicating it's forged from a high-quality ore. The metal should have a slightly worn and used look, with subtle scratches and notches. Ensure the style is consistent with the low-poly and slightly pixelated graphics of the RuneScape 2007 era.",
