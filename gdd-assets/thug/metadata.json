  "detailedPrompt": "\"Generate a 3D character asset inspired by RuneScape 2, specifically a thug. The character should be standing in a T-pose for rigging compatibility. He should be masculine with a muscular build, adorned in worn-out and rugged clothing, consistent with the low-poly and pixelated graphics of the 2007 RuneScape style. The thug should have a menacing facial expression with a scar running down one cheek, no weapons but clenched fists. His attire should consist of a torn, dark leather tunic, dirty brown trousers, and worn-out boots, all with distinct texture details to reflect the rough and ready nature of his profession.\"",
