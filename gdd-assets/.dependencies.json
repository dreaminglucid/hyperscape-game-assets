      "detailedPrompt": "The Basic Log model is a cylindrical shape with a length approximately four times its diameter. The geometry is clean and simple with a low poly count, perfectly fitting for the RuneScape 2007 style. \n\nThe model's ends are flat, emulating a freshly cut log. The body is slightly irregular with gentle bumps and minor indentations to represent a natural wooden texture without being too specific, keeping the model suitable for retexturing later.\n\nThe color is a neutral gray, allowing for easy application of different materials in the future. The log's silhouette is iconic and instantly recognizable, even at a small scale or from a distance. \n\nThe model does not have any additional features such as branches or leaves, keeping the design clean and simple. The log lays flat on its side, making it ideal for stacking or arranging in various configurations.",

It is a neutral gray color, with no specific texture. The diameter is consistent along this length, and ends abruptly where the arrowhead begins.\n\n2. ARROWHEAD: The arrowhead is a simple, low-poly pyramid shape located at the top end of the shaft. It is slightly larger than the shaft diameter. It is a slightly darker gray than the shaft.\n\n3. FLETCHING: At the opposite end of the arrowhead, three equally spaced, low-poly triangular shapes represent the feathers or fletching. They are about one-fifth of the total arrow length and have a slightly lighter gray color than the shaft. \n\n4. NOCK: The very end of the shaft, behind the fletching, is a small cylindrical indent designed to accommodate the bowstring.\n\nOverall, the arrow maintains a clean and simple geometric design, with a clear silhouette that is instantly recognizable. The neutral color palette allows for easy retexturing later. The model reflects the iconic old-school RuneScape 2007 style, with its low-poly count and simple shapes.",

      "detailedPrompt": "Model Description:\n\nThis model depicts a pair of basic metal leg armor, designed in the low-poly, old-school RuneScape 2007 style. \n\nStarting from the top, the thigh guards are cylindrical, wrapping around the legs. They're segmented into three parts, each overlapping the one below to allow for movement. The segments have a basic, clean, and smooth geometric shape, with slight curves to mimic the shape of a leg. \n\nMoving downwards, the knee guards are semi-spherical and slightly larger than the segments of the thigh guards. They are connected to both the thigh guards and shin guards by small, flat rectangular plates, allowing for hinge-like movement.\n\nThe shin guards, similar to the thigh guards, are also cylindrical and segmented into three parts for mobility. They taper slightly toward the ankles, reflecting the natural shape of a leg. \n\nThe foot guards are shaped like simplified, slightly elongated shoes, covering the top of the feet and terminating at a blunt point to allow room for the toes. They are connected to the shin guards by another set of small, flat rectangular plates.\n\nThe entire model is in neutral shades of gray, with no specific material textures applied, ready for retexturing. Its silhouette is simple, iconic, and easily recognizable as leg armor, with clean geometry and clear shapes. The model is also symmetrical, with both leg armors being identical.",

It has a slightly convex shape to accommodate the chest and abdomen of the wearer. The shoulders are covered with small, rounded caps that extend to the upper arm. The back mirrors the front in shape and structure.\n\nGeometry and Detail: The armor features clean, low-poly geometry. The chest and back panels are each made up of a grid of small, flat polygons. The shoulder caps are hemispherical, composed of a half-dome of polygons. Some minor detailing includes a low-poly belt at the waist, and vertical seam lines running down the middle of both the front and back panels for added visual interest.\n\nColor and Texture: The model is rendered in a neutral gray color, with a flat, matte surface texture. There are no material-specific textures, making it suitable for retexturing with different materials later.\n\nStyle: The model adheres to the Old School RuneScape 2007 style, with a low poly count, simple shapes, and iconic silhouette. It's reminiscent of the game's signature aesthetic, with its charmingly blocky and simplistic design.",
