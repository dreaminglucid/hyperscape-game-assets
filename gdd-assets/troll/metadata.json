  "detailedPrompt": "A RuneScape 2007-style troll, standing in T-pose for rigging compatibility. The troll is hulking and muscular, with the characteristically exaggerated proportions typical of the RuneScape aesthetic. Its skin is a rough, stony texture with a mossy green hue. The face features prominent tusky teeth protruding from a wide, gnarled mouth, and beady, crimson eyes peering out from under heavy, knotted brows. Despite being unarmed, the troll's large, clawed hands, outstretched in the T-pose, imply inherent menace. Its lower body is clad in tattered, earthy brown burlap trousers, with visible patches and stitches, demonstrating the RuneScape's low-polygon, simplistic textures.",
