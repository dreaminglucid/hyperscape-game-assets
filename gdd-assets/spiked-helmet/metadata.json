  "description": "a runescape 2 inspired spiked helmet. no base, no stand, only the helmet nothing else no exceptions",
  "detailedPrompt": "Generate a 3D asset inspired by the art style of Runescape 2007: an intricately designed spiked helmet. This helmet should be void of any base or stand, focusing solely on the object itself. The helmet should exhibit a rugged, worn-out look to reflect the gritty atmosphere of the game. The design should incorporate a series of sharp, menacing spikes protruding from the helmet's surface in a symmetrical pattern. The material of the helmet should resemble aged, weathered iron with a dull, matte finish, hinting at countless battles. The form should be slightly oval, to mimic the shape of a human head, and should feature intricate geometric details, such as engraved patterns around the base and eye slits. Ensure consistency with the Runescape 2007 simplistic, low-poly style.",
